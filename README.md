# **Multi Agent  Project Intersection**

## **Materia:** Multi-Agentes y Graficas

### Introducción

We used mesa, a python library along others, to createa multiagent simulation simulatating a cross intersection between trffic lights, cars, and pedestians. We created two simulations in python and then used unity to simulate it.

We wanted to show that by introducing a smart traffic light in this system; the mobility of an intersection can be made more efficient by at least 20% in time. By doing so, it can determine the most optimal crossing time based on the number of pedestrians and/or vehicles at crosswalks and intersections, respectively. We will be able to determine the percentage of efficiency by comparing our intelligent agent with a traffic light that controls the flow of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic with a constant time.

We succeded in making a smart traffic light that is 52% more time-efficient, since it is able to finish the same simulation with the equal number of cars and pedestrians in less steps.
